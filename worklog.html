			<h3>
				HTML Tags Learnt
			</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt> a </dt>
						<dd>- This tag creates a hyperlink that allows the user to navigate to another page. I learnt this tag very early on in my lessons and it allowed me a significant amount of time to be familiar. </dd>
					<dt> dl/dt/dd </dt>
						<dd>- These tags create the detailed list element of websites, this tag allows you to add discriptive elements to any list and makes it easier for you to set out information. This tag has proved very useful for me and an example of it is this list you are reading. It is all made in dl/dt/dd. </dd>
					<dt> article </dt>
						<dd>- This tag is an HTML5 tag that allows the user to separate the page out further. It means that there is more CSS customization available to the user. </dd>
					<dt> section </dt>
						<dd>- This is also an HTML5 tag that allows the user to separate the page out even further. It can also be customized through CSS. </dd>
				</dl>
			<h3>
				CSS Declarations Learnt
			</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt> text-decoration </dt>
						<dd>- The text-decoration property specifies the decoration added to text. This was useful for me to know as I needed to take the decoration off of my hyperlinks, this meant i could customize them and make them more user friendly.  </dd>
					<dt> border-radius </dt>
						<dd>- The border-radius property is a shorthand property for setting the four border-radius properties. It is useful for making sections and text easier to read. </dd>
					<dt> margin </dt>
						<dd>- This specifies the margin around the chosen tag, it makes space around it and moves the text in the direction you chose. You can have top, bottom, left and right margins. </dd>
					<dt> text-align </dt>
						<dd>- The text-align property specifies the horizontal alignment of text in an element. This was useful for me to know how to fit all text on to a page.  </dd>
				</dl>
			<h3>
				Information on Accessibility
			</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt> Access Keys </dt>
						<dd>- Access keys allow user to navigate through a web site without having to use the mouse. This adds accessibility to a site and allows users who dont have a mouse to use the site properly. </dd>
					<dt> Contrasting Colours </dt>
						<dd>- Having contrasting colours on a website means that users will be able to read information more easily. This website has a contrast ratio of 16.8:1 which is above the required amount for normal reading. </dd>
					<dt> Reading Width </dt>
						<dd>- The reading width of a page is important for some people to read, this is because the eye gets tired when it has to follow all the way to the end of a page. This site has a maximum reading width that is set in the middle of the page.</dd>
					<dt> Alt Tags for pictures </dt>
						<dd>- Alt tags for pictures are used in case the user cannot see the pictures. They are useful for when a screen reader is reading the page as it will read the alt tag and discribe the picture on the page.  </dd>
				</dl>
			<h3>
				Researching
			</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt> Google Scholar </dt>
						<dd>- I learnt how to effectively use google scholar to research for my literature review, this tool allowed me to look at scholarly works all over the internet and refernce information from them easily. </dd>
					<dt> Uni Library Website </dt>
						<dd>- The univesity library website allows me to access ebooks and order books from the library. This was also another useful tool when researching for my literature review. </dd>
